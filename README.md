### Shell Script Automation for Database Validation and Action
 
This repository contains two essential shell scripts designed to automate database processes through validation and subsequent action based on validation outcomes.
 
#### 1. Validation Script
- Logs into a specified database.
- Executes necessary queries to process batch counts.
- Fetches relevant data to identify if manual intervention is required.
- Logs the output for further action.
 
#### 2. Automation Script
- Monitors the output of the validation script.
- Triggers automated actions if manual intervention is detected as necessary.
- Executes specific database queries and tasks based on validation results.
- Ensures smooth operation by maintaining automated processes unless issues are found.
 
These scripts are crucial for ensuring efficient database management by automating routine checks and actions, reducing the need for manual intervention, and maintaining system integrity.
